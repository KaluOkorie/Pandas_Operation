## Project Overview
This portfolio project demonstrates essential pandas operations through a practical analysis of student performance data. 
By examining academic scores across math, reading, and writing, the analysis uncovers performance patterns, 
highlights achievement gaps, and provides actionable insights to support educational improvement and data-informed decision-making.

## Project Goals
- Demonstrate core pandas operations for data analysis
- Identify academic performance patterns and achievement gaps
- Provide data-driven recommendations for educational institutions
- Showcase technical skills in a real-world context
